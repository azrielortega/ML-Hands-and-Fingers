    "### Dataset\n",
    "The Fingers Dataset contains images of a hand holding up fingers from 1 - 5. It includes left-hand and right-hand images, where the left-hand images are generated by flipping the right-hand images. There are 21600 images and have a size of 128 by 128 pixels. The training set will use 18000 images, and the testing set will have 3600. Images are pre-processed by centering them by their center of mass and adding noise patterns to the background. The images were labeled from the last two characters of their file name, L and R for Left and Right; 0,1,2,3,4,5 for the number of fingers raised.\n",
