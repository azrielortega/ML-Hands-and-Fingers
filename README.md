# STITNSY-Project

### Description
A machine learning project that focuses on predicting the number of fingers raised in an image and identifying which hand was used. The model used for this project was experimented on with two popular neural network architectures, ResNet and MobileNet. In addition to building the model, data analysis and modeling were also included in the Jupyter notebook. This involved processing and preparing the dataset, exploring the data to identify any patterns or anomalies, and selecting the appropriate features for training the model. The Jupyter notebook also included various machine learning techniques for improving the model's accuracy and performance, such as hyperparameter tuning and regularization.
